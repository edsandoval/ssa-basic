# Sensor Service Basic

Implementation of a simple android foreground service to detect inactivity of the phone, for a configured number of hour(s).

The code uses the accelerometer to detect significant changes that indicate movement of the phone. When it does not detect movement in a number of hours, it launches an SMS alert.
